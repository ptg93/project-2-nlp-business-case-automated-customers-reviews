In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime Sample use case100 mA 997 mAh 10 hrs Low-power LED flashlight200 mA 914 mAh 4.5 hrs Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA 623 mAh 1.5 hrs Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 1005 mAh 10 hrs200 mA 864 mAh 4.3 hrs400 mA 670 mAh 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 908 mAh 9 hrs200 mA 590 mAh 2.9 hrs400 mA 443 mAh 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment.

These batteries are no exception. There are many reviewers who will say these batteries are terrible, good, great, awesome, unsurpassed, etc. It seems the general consensus is these batteries are great for their intended purpose.First, I recommend you take a look at C (https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A35H8Y36S43CSG/refcmcrdppdp) review. This is a highly credible review as he put in his time and effort to test the batteries out. With that said, here are my two cents on batteries I have previously bought on Amazon:Rayovac: Smart choice for your portable digital electronics, lasting just a little less long as other leading brands. They are perfect for powering low-drain devices like clocks, radios, remote controls and low-powered flashlights. If you're looking for an affordable and reliable battery, get these. But it only works for me on 3-5 uses using my eyelash curler. These are good and cheap batteries. I use them for simple things that don't require a lot of power, such as my computer mouse. They do not last long, but for the price I pay I don't expect them to. if I want a quick battery that isn't going to cost more than a couple dollars I usually go with these.Duracell:Despite the shorter use by date (3/2021) than my recently purchased Energizer Industrial AAA alkalines (12/2026), these ProCell (Duracell) alkaline AAA cells have the highest open circuit voltage I've ever measured. I admit to being a price shopper, opting for 48 for 15 (Prime) rather than 24 for 11. If I get results similar to the ProCell AA and D cells I recently purchased, the AAA's should be good performers. Sadly, they are a too-tight fit to use in my recent Surefire Titan (flashlight) one AAA cell LED flashlight - but that is on the Surefire. I received decent life on these batteries besides using them in a flashlight (remote control car, remote, smoke alarm (7 months) and others. Good batteries for the right price.Energizer:I have used these in my mouse for my computer, my Xbox 360 Remote and my cable box remote. Part of me feels like these didn't last as long as they could have, but my mouse never gets shut off and my Xbox gets used relatively often (I'm not a gamer, but I use the system to watch movies).I read other reviews where people say that one of the sellers is selling used batteries I didn't have that experience. Mine arrived in a package that didn't seem to have been tampered with prior to shipping.I just ordered some Duracell Procell batteries. I want to see if they'll last longer than these did and they did not.Energizer Lithium:I put these batteries into all of the electronic Z-wave door locks that I own, because the Duracell alkaline batteries that I had been using were dying very quickly (they'd only last a about 2 months, and rechargeable ones would only last 3-4 weeks). The locks are very low-drain because most of the time they are just sitting there, but when you unlock or lock it uses a large burst of energy. And that's exactly the type of device that lithium batteries are recommended to be used in. I installed these about 4 months ago and they're all still showing 100 charge in my system control panel! Granted it only moves in 25 levels so it could be anywhere from 76-100, but still even if it depleted at a rate of 25 every 4 months that means they'll be good for at least 1 year before being replaced. That's about 6x longer than alkaline batteries would last, or if they live up to the claim of 8x then I'll get 16 months out of them. Either way I'll be saving a lot of time and money not having to swap out batteries every few months, I can now put it on my yearly to-do list instead.I also use the 9V batteries in my smoke detectors, and according to the specs they should only need to be changed every 10 years instead of the 2 years that I was getting with alkalines. Sure they are 5-7x more expensive (depending if you buy in bulk or not), but I'll gladly pay that price to not have to get up on a ladder in the middle of the night to swap out beeping smoke detector batteries all the time.Amazon Basics Batteries:The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because you can't really use them in products that have a higher voltage demand like you would get with the Energizer lithium. For the most part, they will perform like all the major brand with the exception of Rayovac. I find these last longer than then. As for regular Energizer and Duracell, I feel the difference is negligible. Some may or may not last longer than the Amazon brand while the others WILL last longer. I suppose it depends on the application they are used for.So in turn, yes I would recommend these to the typical consumer. The price is cheaper, the quality should be comparable to the rest. I would give them a try. If they are crappy then youre out a couple of bucks. Probably the same price when you decided to order the liver and onions you didnt like at so and so :P Very good for the price\n","Index: 8380, Review: AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar.

This is a simply designed but good looking backpack that could meet most students' needs.The bag is basically a simple, but stylish enough design, with grey highlights and some orange piping on the front. There are enough characteristics to make the bag distinctive but there is no obvious branding on the front. If you look closely, you can find the Amazon basics logo embossed on the black zippers. But you'd have to look really closely. The shoulder straps are backed with a mesh-like material that reduces slippage and are sufficiently wide and padded so that they are comfortable.The main compartment is generous in size, open and closed with two zippers, and is basically broken up into two areas. The back area is generously padded on both sides and is meant to house the laptop. The padding is as good as or even more generous than what I have seen in standard backpacks made by companies like JanSport or L.L. Bean. There is a single large sleeve in front of the padding that is large enough to hold a standard, letter-sized manilla folder filled with papers. The front compartment is basically wide open and has room for traditional textbooks (assuming people still use these) or any other paraphernalia.There are two compartments in the front. There is mid-sized compartment that is in front of the main compartment and a smaller front compartment with the obligatory organizer/pockets to hold pens, a cellphone etc. There is even an internal clip in the front compartment for keys.Additionally, there are small mesh pockets on the sides of the pack and a quick-access, zippered pocket on the very top of the pack. There's even a small mesh pocket on the bottom of the left shoulder strap.Although I doubt that this is ballistic nylon, it appears to be very well made. The edges line up very well and there is no dog-earing in the fabric. The top handle is only minimally padded and a bit flimsy for a pack this size. Clearly, you could lift the pack via the handle to move it from the floor to your desk, but the handle isn't comfortable or sturdy enough to carry the pack like a suitcase. The nylon that makes up the dividers is stiff and makes an audible crinkly sound when manipulated. This likely will go away over time, but if you are late to class and walking into a quiet lecture hall this could be a distraction.The zippers move easily. They are large enough to grip and they all have nylon tags sewn to the end to make them easier to pull. The zippers seem strong enough for a pack of this size and caliber.All-in-all this is a very well made back pack at an excellent price point. It may not win major style points for some students, but it is a great basic backpack. Great basic backpack that compares favorably with better known brand name packs\n","Index: 15434, Review: I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system.

It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of \"back\" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the \"X\" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable.

You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen.

Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.

Great price on an awesome little tablet\n","Index: 17760, Review: Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. Reasons I Love My Kindle Oasis\n","Index: 17761, Review: Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5\" wide by 5.5\" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The \"page\" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also \"follow\", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!

Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you. Great price on an awesome little tablet\n","Index: 19151, Review: Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5\" wide by 5.5\" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The \"page\" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also \"follow\", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine! Remarkably Small and Lightweight\n","Index: 22762, Review: Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.

Remarkably Small and Lightweight\n","Index: 24278, Review: I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of \"back\" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the \"X\" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of \"new items.\" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under \"new items\" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the \"home\" menu. It's the \"recent\" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's \"On Deck\" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the \"on deck\" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year.

It was bundled with a solid bumper case and has a kid mode interface. She insisted on using her brother's iPad constantly. Not to say there is anything wrong with this product, it just wasn't for her. Almost Thought this would be perfect for my two children. The case, warranty and pass to download unlimited apps seemed great. However, the pad is sometimes unresponsive and inaccurate-which can be frustrating for children. The case is a little too bulky. And it can be confusing for children who want to push an icon to play but it instead downloads. There is a definite learning curve that they will overcome in time but it could be more user friendly for younger users. alright tablet This tablet is OK, sometimes it's kind of slow. Loads for a while before opening app. Storage has been good. 32 GB. I gave my son the freedom to download any game he wanted on prime time. And after 2 months he still has like 3gb left of space. Not recommend for kids over 10 years old. My son is 4 and sometimes he gets mad because tablet gets slow. Still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primetime for $80 An OK tablet Battery doesn't last the up to 7 hours estimate. Didn't even last 4 hours one day. Watches video mostly but should last longer than that. Battery sucks it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok Beginner tablet I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item. Charging Ports The tablet could be great for my 4 year old daughter if it worked properly. As of right now I need to return it to see if a new one will work. There are black and grey lines across the screen most of the time. It will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it. I am hoping a new one will not be faulty. Could be a great tablet I did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. Too much of the same thing. Decent game so far This makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but I'm not sure I'd want it as an adult. There are much better tablets on the market. But since it's cheap, that's to be expected. Decent Kids Edition Works fine on wifi, otherwise a little slow. My kid enjoys it though. For the price it's good. Decent, does the job returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made. Device is not as rugged as it could be returning Wish it was easier to understand set up so children don't accidently charge to my account. Difficult to learn how to play some of the games It's difficult to navigate and not user friendly. I was hoping for better results Difficult to navigate There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated. Does what it says, missing one key feature My 4yr old was able to operate it flawlessly. The included case works its magic to keep the tablet from any accidental screen cracks. Easy setup The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible. Fair It's ok but I rather have bought Samsung Galaxy Tab Good A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine. Good but SLOW This device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual. Good for 4 year old A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine. Good for kids but SLOW Christmas gift for 8 yr. Ended up returning. too slow and not enough content for our 8 yr old. Kids....... Great 2yr protection tho Good for little kids Good tablet to take for my child to play on when out to dinner. Keeps him busy. Good for nights out Grandson became board with what it offers. Plug wears out fast Good for young kids This looked easy, but hard to setup if no experience with other than Apple products Good product but hard to setup for Grandson I bought this for my 8year old son, he loves it just has very limited games on it good starter tablet This tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children! Good tablet 4 kids Good tablet. Easy to use for 5 yr. Not as many free stuff as expected. Have to pay for most games, movies and books. Good tablet for kids Right after we bought it the charging port broke but it was very easy to get the tablet replaced and shipped to our house. It's not very operations friendly and comes with very little instruction. Good warranty and protection I would recommend this tablet for an older child. Maybe 7 and up. Good, but not great The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. And also how fast the SD card got filled with items from Amazon OS that's on the tablet without the user knowing. On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful great beginners kids tablet The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing. Great bumper I purchased 2 others for my 5 & 6yr-olds, and my 3yr-old niece enjoyed playing theirs so much I then bought this one for her. The included 1yr subscription to free-time is awsome for the kids! Parental controls are great, and included apps are helpful.The lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose, as the cord falls out ALL the time! Very Frustrating! Great for a Beginner Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do! Great for a kid I love this tablet and the games. But battery sucks. It goes dead really fast and it freezes up a lot. Great for kids Only good for kids and games. Battery life is good. Great for kids Son loves it........................................ Great for kids This was easy to setup and easy to hand over to my 4 yr old. She loves the different games and apps that are available to her. Great for kids Good for alittle ones for games and movies picture not so clear but not expensive Great for small kids These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account. Great for the kids... no Google Play Store We purchased this kindle for our 3 yr old since it was lightweight and easy to use. If he would only let one of figure out apps and other functions. So the parental setting are great but havent gotten much further than that Great for toddlers I have 3 autistic kids and is great cause they can be rough . Great kids tablet I am happy so far with this tablet. It offers great protection for use with kids but is a little pricey for the lackluster performance. Great for kids. Great protection, decent performance My daughter lovethis tablet.. only problem is it cant connect to my home wifi which is verizon Great tablet for toddler Tablet is great. I am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle. We started her at 10 months on an Ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost 2. Not so, she is struggling to navigate in the kindle. I am not able to transfer her games and movies. Great tablet, just not for my daughter I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not. I bought it as a gift I purchased this item for my 7yr old daughter. We like it but we can't get the pictures of the apps to show I like it Its a nice little set up but it's slow. I wish I would have investigated them a little more before just jumping in. I like it but.... I like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k I love it This is going to be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so we don't know how good it is yet but we where going to put so games on it so it is ready to go and we couldn't because you have to have a amazon account to do anything with it. It is a Christmas gift It's a good piece of technology it's just not connecting to the wifi It's a good product It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games/apps are appropriate. Battery life is absolutely terrible. It's ok. volume is a problem we have to take off the protective case for it to sound clear. It's okay I'm a big fan of Amazon and their products, but this tablet is just ok. The build quality is great and the image is very good, but the software is mediocre at best. Worth the price. Just OK Battery dies after an hour...should last longer for the money. Will not bold charge. Kiddo LOVES it Needs to be more simpler. parental contorl still need to be better kids fun A few problems with games loading but over all good Kids loved it It was ok. You need Internet. The SDmini is a hassle. Kids Tablet I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol. That made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first. Besides that, it's a good product. Kind of complicated For a five year old this worked fine but was a bit slow loading games. But 5 year olds these days want it immediately. Like the kid friendly free books and games. It worked well with downloaded Disney movies and Netflix. May have to get one for 2 year old suster they both live it Kind of slow loading it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad kindle kids fire I absolutely love how u. An switch from dif accounts Love kids mode Kids will love this tablet, has a camera and kids can make movies with it. Wonderful for a child with a good imagination love this product, easy and fun for kids! I got 2 of this for kids 5 and 3 it is a pretty good tablet, easy to navigate for the children but (and this is on me for not researching) but kid content is only free for a year, after that you gotta pay a monthly fee which is cheaper if you are a prime member, but still...Now reason why I'm about to return them! You CANNOT get YouTube kids at all! No google apps. You can get some YouTube kids clones on the adult profile and add them to the kid's profile but they stink. They're full of commercials.So I wasn't expecting this tablet to be like an iPad but this is a deal breaker for me. Mom review, no techie stuff. At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids. My daughter likes it I bought this for my two year old grandson but the restrictions were too much. My grandson needed more These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account. My kids love these I was hoping he would not want to put it down, like the other tablet he had (sprout chubby )But he stills wants my phone. Nice size I was completely under the impression that this tablet was child friendly but there are no built in restrictions so my son was able to purchase numerous apps and movies. My son usually uses my wife's ipad so I thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child. If you buy this tablet, IMMEDIATELY change the settings to require a PIN to make purchases.I think the age recommendation should be 5+ not 3+. No automatic restrictions for children I bought this for 3 year old to replace an older Ipad. it was functional but no where near level of ipad. This is understandable based on price difference/ I returned to store. Not a bad product I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels. Not as good as I'd hoped Good for little kids, it runs a little slow though not bad Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want. Not bad I bought this for my 2-year old. She liked it for the first few days and then she went back to playing with my ipad. If I hadn't already introduce her to the ipad, I think she would have been fine with this. Not bad Good features for kids, but definitely not enough storage. You'll need to get an SD card and set things to download to that or it will freeze and stop working. Not enough storage I would would not recommend this for a child. It's not kid friendly at all. I have purchased 4 of them for my grandson and nephews and 3 was was damaged within a couple months. I think this product is is a better fit for adults. Not kid friendly Overall I wasn't too impressed with his tablet. Actually returned it for an iPad mini bc my kid like it better and it was easier to use. Not too kid friendly I purchased this for my 4 year old to play. It was not as user friendly as described and VERY slow. It keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. I was told that I would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. It may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us. Not what I was looking for Not a lot of memory, dies fast. Great games........ Okay This is one of the perfect tab for kids, I bought it for my niece and she loved it. Perfect Tab My toddler did not like this tablet. It was a bit slow for her. Instead, she preferred an iPad over the Kindle Kids version. Processor is slow Wish it was a bit faster loading and browsing, but functions as you would expect for kid friendly product. I would spend the extra money next time for a tablet designed for adults but had strong parental controls Slow but good for kids Slow performance and charging port very low poor quality it gets frozen most of the times Slow performance The tablet itself was nice, but the screen was to small for books, videos, and minecraft. Small screen for books and videos You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally. So so I have a few issues with this tablet. Mainly the fact that I can't get Google services on it, not even YouTube. Aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. The port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long. Sturdy Tablet Great case ok tablet no Android play store. Weak micro usb port. It's isn't an straight out the box tablet. Had to install Android play store on it. And as far as the charging port goes I'm on my 3rd one but best buy are the best with their return policy... Tablet not for kids Perfect for that age group that I bought it for she 10and loves it. The camera and Cover are great We found there to be too many pop up ads and returned it. Too many pop up ads It was working great then all of a sudden it wouldnt come on Very disappointed This is the 2nd one I have bought. The first one went out before the 1 year. I contacted Amazon and the warranty for these was only 90 days. It is a good tablet for kids, but if you are looking for something long term. I would spend the extra $$ for at least something that has a 1 year limited warranty. Very good table for the price Very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don't work very well , charging port very low quality Very slow There's not much difference in the regular Kindle. Wait till it goes on sale. Wait till it goes on sale. This product works, but works slow compared to Apple and some Android phones/tablets. Like I stated in my summary... you pay for what you get. No major issues thus far. You pay for what you get\",\n          \"In my opinion these did not last anywhere near as long as Duracel in things like LED candles (which is crazy) and trail cameras. Cameras were not exposed to cold temps more or less than other batteries. WE buy in bulk for the north house. Amazon Basics is great for things like sheets and beeding and towels. In my opinion the battery life, in the large package of aaa and aa size we purchased were lacking. ... last anywhere near as long as Duracel in things like LED candles (which is crazy) and trail cameras If it's possible to have gotten a dud batch I sure got it. We BLEW through all these batteries in less than a month. My kids toys aren't that super powered and even in remotes I was having to change batteries way too often. For example the magic touch counting toy, the store batteries lasted 3 years. Popped in some Amazon batteries, 1 month and the second child didn't play with it nearly as much as the first. For the price it was worth the try but I'm going back to the other brands. A bad batch I can only use these on those indoor flameless candles and even then, they dont last very long...a little disappointed... a little disappointed.. TERRIBLE! Barely lasted three hours during a digital camera shoot where Duracell lasts multiple days. A Waste of Money Use these in a wireless BT mouse. Has about 30 less life as copper top brand. Good price, but most likely will not buy again. About 30 less life as other brand - but price is hard to ignore We use battery operated candles with timers. The batteries normally have to be changed once a month. These cheap batteries lasted 2 weeks. I thought these batteries were a good deal, but I was wrong. All batteries are not created equal... Maybe mine is a bad batch, had a serious leak on one of them, these batteries seem to last as long as duracells but duracells never leaked in my experience Almost ruined my electronics Does not last as long as Duracell quantum. These were sent as a supplement Amazon performance batteries At least half of this batch had no charge, or at least so little that they died within an hour of being put in a walkie-talkie. Very disappointed At least half of these had little to no charge These were OK. I don't think I'll but them in the future. I prefer Energizers. Average These batteries won't last long. An led flashlight will drain them in a hurry. I usually like Amazon products but this is one to avoid. Avoid these. They for really fast Bad batteries Some of the four packs (02-2027) are bad upon first use. Bad batteries within 36PK They last a day in an xbox controller, if you're lucky Bad life Somewhat disappointed with these batteries. They die rather quickly. I'm not using them for things that use a lot of power either. Like the remote for my TV. I have to change them frequently. Expiration date of 2026, but they go fast, unless I got a bad batch. I would rate them down there with cheap Rav-o-vac or a grocery store brand. Batteries don't last long Batteries seem to work fine but they are packaged in multiples of 4 and it's an annoyance to break open a new pack each time. What's the point in buying in bulk with so much packaging Batteries seem to work fine but they are packaged in multiples of 4 and ... Breaks down too fast and won't run my trail camera but around 6 hours. Battery disappointment These batteries did their job but did not last very long at all. At the time of writing this I used them about two months. Normally that would be good, but I only was using them in a set of LED string lights that I kept on at most an hour a day. In the past month I barely used them at all, because the batteries had started to die and alter the color of the lights. I had expected to get a lot longer use out of them, considering other brands I only need to change every six months at earliest. Battery life isn't very long I've had several of these 'fail' long before they should have. Several instances of having to replace them much sooner that competitors batteries. Battery Life Too Short I put these in a Pumpkin candle for Halloween and they lasted 4 days. I put them in a Flameless candle set of 5 and they lasted one week set on a timer to go on for 5 hours a night. These are really not economical. Best to pay the price for the good ones. Best to pay the price for the good ones I have encountered several AmazonBasics batteries lately which were dead on arrival. Since they are cheap, I just throw them in the trash and try some more. However this is concerning. If this occurs much more I will stop using them and purchase more traditional, reliable brands. Simply beware when you purchase these, some bad ones may be mixed in the batch. Beware that some dead batteries may be mixed in the batch For some reason, they are not working very well with my wireless mouse. Mouse pointer mover very slowly when I use these batteries, but it works fine when I use different batteries but it works fine when I use different This set of batteries exploded being stored in my garage, right next to a set of duracell. Duracell is fine. Buy better rechargeable. The ones that work work fine however I've just had to toss eight because they're dead. don't work. not happy Buyer beware I use these for my son's Thomas and friends trains, and they didn't last very long. Maybe 2 days at the most. Won't be ordering these again. Cancelling my subscription Probably should have rated these one star, but I didn't because I like Amazon as a whole. These batteries are soooo bad though! They were comparable to the Kirkland ones at Costco in price so I decided to switch things up and try these out. Huge mistake. These last half the life of Kirkland's. Not kidding. Not worth it. These are cheap!!!!!!!! cheap and short life Only 3 worked out of the entire pack. Cheap and weak They sure wore out quick! We normally go thru about a dozen AAA batteries in a year. We use them most for TV remotes and wireless mouses. But we replacing these every month. I was quite amazed at how quickly they were wearing out! I have a battery checker and once they hit yellow, they were done.Cheap batteries but I would not recommend nor will I buy again. Cheap batteries, Short Life. They're cheap but we went through these in less than half the time of the previous pack of the same, which was Duracell. I was hoping the brand wouldn't matter but it seems that in this case, it does. Cheap but definitely doesn't last as long as other brands Very nice looking in picture and from a distance but the clock itself is cheaply made....The actual clock mechanism stopped working twice and doesn't work at all now. Cheaply made wall clock These batteries held up about as well as dollar store batteries. Very disappointed in quality. Comparable to Dollar Store Batteries. While most, modern day batteries no longer contain mercury, the Amazon basics battery line unfortunately does. Which means they're bad for the environment, and not able to be disposed of other than in appropriate hazardous waste. I'll spend the extra few dollars and buy a name brand Contains mercury :( I bought these for remotes in my home. I'm constantly having to change them and sometimes the brand new batteries don't work. Didn't last These batteries die out a lot faster than the Duracell batteries we normally purchase. Yes, they are cheaper, but unfortunately more batteries are ending up in the landfills because we are going through these too fast. Die Out Quick Holds basically a 30 minute steady usage charge and dies. We used these in microphones, and they died within the 30-40 minute range, fully charged.It also seems that the older they get, the longer it takes to charge and the faster they die out. Not very reliable, unfortunately. Dies quickly Disappointed by the amount of time these batteries lasted. Disappointed Do not hold charge as well as major brands. Disappointed I love Amazon, but these aren't at the same level as the big brands. I use them in some monitoring devices in my home. Typically I would need to change these every 3 months, but these are lasting about 6-7 weeks at best. They're ok, but just don't have the life expectancy I need. Disappointed Disappointed with this product. Used them for led candles and had to wiggle them around to get them to work. At the same time I also purchase ACDelco Batteries because Amazon would only allow the purchase of one box. I'm glad I did because the ACDelco batteries worked great! I would not purchase AmazonBasics batteries again. Disappointed with this product For some reason, these just haven't held a charge the way the Duracells I've used the past do. I've used these in those small-wired-LED lights you can use for decorations. Those lights take 3 AA batteries and while the old Duracells I've used lasted several months on a 4-hour on, 16 hour-off timer, these are lasting just a few weeks. Disappointing. I expected more from AmazonBasics. Batteries don't last that long I bought these for some of the little round lights that go in your closets or under your cabinets they didn't make it a week which was sad. Discharge very quickly batteries last a fraction of the time that most of the other well known battery brands do Do not last long Does not last. Very short life span. Does not last. Very short life span. I was really excited to find a great deal on batteries. I would have to say if you just used these batteries for remote controls. And basic stuff then this would be the battery pick hands down. I could not believe how many batteries I went through for a child's toy. These batteries don't hold there ground against brand name. I burnt through 24 amazon batteries in one month on my son's hot wheel course. Just basic use maybe an hour a day at most. Brand name has lasted 2 months. Doesn't hold up It doesn't work with my Amazon wireless mouse doesn't work with wireless mouse I use it for the roku remote and it runs out so fast, holds for about 2-3 weeks (just like the chineese batteries), Don't buy those! Good price but batteries just don't last as long as name brands. My hope was to power Christmas decorations through the holidays and save a few bucks. Many of these batteries did not make it. In the future I will stick with proven brands. Don't last After using two sets of these, I am going to agree with other reviewers and say that they don't last as long as name brand batteries. Don't last long enough Won't buy again, I replaced batteries in my smoke detectors with these less than two months ago, replacing again with Duracell. The last Duracell batteries lasted almost 3 years in the same detectors. Don't waste your money on these, spend a little more for a good product. Don't waste your money on these I use a lot of batteries for lighted decorations all year round. I tried these out during Halloween. They were the worst. I tested them against Sams Club batteries, Harbor Freight Tools batteries and duracell. The amazon always died first. They even leaked that battery acid out after a few hours of use. Just horrible. I removed these from my subscribe and save list. I won't buy again. Don't waste your money on these amazon batteries. The original Amazon Basics in the solid silver wrapping were great. These seem to have about a half life of those. Wouldn't recommend for use. Don't waste your monies they dont last long at all not worth buying DONT BUY Not very long lasting batteries.... Duds These batteries are HYPED! Duracell always wins. I bought them for electronic circuit for my experiments and I can clearly see how they fail against Duracell AAA batteries. I also wonder about the review someone has put that shows the performance plots. Under standard conditions doesn't matter, batteries need to perform the way consumers use them. To be fair, these batteries are better but don't show them as the best in the world, no way! Duracell is way better! I gave one star because they were batteries and did not explode in my face which is a major plus. However, if you need batteries for anything you use on a daily basis outside a tv remote then do not buy. These batteries do not last as long as duracell or energizer by far, and i wish i was getting paid to say that. Spend the extra dollars and buy a better battery. Eh Good price but batteries don't last long compared to other brands expected more quality After less than 6mos I started seeing a lot of leakage. Fell apart quickly Had to wait for more than a month for delivery. First few uses of product has not been good. In a head set had to replace batteries (3) with very small usage, evenings only, had to already replace batteries. The AAA pro cells we normally order usually last a week or better with daily use. I am not pleased with this product. First few uses of product has not been good. In a head set had to replace batteries ... I used it in a computer key board. First pair lasted only half of the time of other brand like DURACELL.I will see if the second pair does any better. First pair lasted only half of the time of other brand like DURACELL. I will see if the second pair ... Never again will I purchase this. The outer cardboard box is frustration-free, but the batteries are tightly shrink-wrapped in groups of four. You need to cut into the wrap to begin to separate the batteries, pull them apart, then cut a little slice into the wrap around each battery. Then figure out how to pull each battery out of its little, plastic strait-jacket.Even if these batteries function well, the hassle of unwrapping them (12 shrink-wrapped sets of four batteries) isn't worth any cost savings. Frustration-FULL inner packaging. Not worth the hassle. Feel like these loose their charge much faster than the brand I used to buy. Will not purchase in the future. Gave it a try Don't last very long Get the big name ones Good value for the money. I use them in kids toys and remote controls where they work fine. For heavy discharge items like flashlights and tools they will not last very long compared to other premium brands. I don't trust them in smoke detectors either. Good for the money. So, I purchased a pack of these a month ago (11-Dec-2015) and was using them as expected, when I hit a snag. At LEAST 3 batteries from this pack were marginal/undervoltage (1.5V) out of the box. I found this out because I had replaced a pair of batteries in one of my remote sensors for my wall mounted indoor weather station because the had sensor stopped working. I thought maybe I had inserted them wrong, but no, the +/- marks matched the batteries. So I tried several times to reset both the sensor and the station with no luck. At one point, I had all of the batteries out to force a reset and put them back. But now my weather station would not power up either.That was the clue I needed. I got my trusty multimeter (with battery tester) and checked out all 5 of the Amazon Basics AA cells. Like all NEW 1.5V batteries, most of them showed 1.6V which is typical. Two of them were at 1.48V, which was just low enough for them to be considered undervoltage. No new AA battery should arrive with 1.5V. This is the first and only time I have ever seen fresh batteries arrive in a not as new condition with caused problems with my electronics.I generally like all of the various Amazon Basics products (mice, HDMI cables, etc.), but this has caused me to have doubts about not only their AA batteries, but all of the house branded products. Buyer beware (Caveat Emptor) seems to be the bottom line. Good Value - Some undervoltage batteries out of the box! Very short life in these... Bad batch Got lemons Great price - but you get what you pay for. In our Xfinity TV remote, these last 25 of the time the Duracell's lasted. Overall, they don't have lasting power like the top brands. Great price - but you get what you pay for I was a little surprised how large a portion of these batteries measured as dead or low out of the box. I did not notice at first but a few batteries in some would last all of a day on low power items. I am currently sitting on 25 dead or extremely low. Great- If you like 25 dead batteries. Half the batteries didn't work! Half the batteries didn't work! I have to change my mouse batteries and keyboard batteries like every two weeks with these..... before it was every few months.... horror story... constantly get ... mouse not connected , keyboard not connected ......sometimes starts within a few days....... going to pay more for the name brands have to replace so often not worth it... cheaper to buy big names I ordered these mainly to use in a set of small LED flashlights. I tried the batteries in three different flashlights, but they didn't work in any of them. I double checked polarity and they were correctly installed. I tried them in a different device didn't work in that either. Amazon sent me a second set free of charge. They still didn't work in any of the flashlights but did work in a remote control and a toy. (I tried a different brand of batteries in the flashlights and they worked fine.) So it was hit and miss with these AAA batteries--2 sets of them. I've used Amazon AA with no problems. Hit and Miss Unfortunately, some of the batteries seem to be duds. I have replaced dead batteries with these, only to still have a dead remote. Great price, but I now know why... Hit or miss... Went on sale 4 days later for 14.40 for 100 batteries. I paid 12.49 for 48 batteries. Hosed again. HOSED I always put new batteries in my three thermostats at the beginning of the heating season in late Sept to make sure they work through the winter. Never had a problem with Energizer or Duracell going the whole year. These batteries from Amazon all had to be replaced in February, won't be using them again. I always put new batteries in my three thermostats at ... I am disappointed with the quality of these batteries. I used them to light some low voltage decoration lights on the ceiling of my bus. They only lasted 1 day. Replaced with Energizer batteries and I am in my 2 week and they are still going strong. I am disappointed with the quality of these batteries I purchased these to try because I needed so many for my Christmas village. Withing 24 hours some of the batteries died so I turned off all of them so I could at least have them on for Christmas. I am very disappointed in them, had to go out and purchase more of the copper top ones which last weeks and weeks to keep my village lit for the holidays. I will not purchase these again. I am very disappointed in them I bought these to use in the wireless mouse I bought at same time. I seem to have to change the batteries to often. I bought these to use in the wireless mouse I ... I have to admit I was not too happy with these and probably won't buy them again. The 'life' on them is extremely short and definitely leave a lot to be desired. I have to admit I was not too happy with these and probably won't buy them again I normally buy the Maxwell brand but thought I'd give these a try. I used them in my led battery operated lights, they were dead in half the time of the Maxwells. I normally buy the Maxwell brand but thought I'd give ... I originally wanted to buy Duracell brand batteries but I bought these instead (Aug. 2016) as they were cheaper. I just today had to remove a set of these from a remote thermometer and they had leaked even though the date printed on the batteries was Jan. 2025. My savings on these cheaper batteries was far less than the cost of my now damaged thermometer. I originally wanted to buy Duracell brand batteries but I ... I put several of these in my mouse battery and had to replace them after only a few days. Will not be buying more. I put several of these in my mouse battery and ... I was hoping these batteries would last more than 4 hours, and since they didn't I don't think the price should be as listed I was hoping these batteries would last more than 4 ... I would have gotten the same quality had I got batteries from the dollar store. I was very disappointed. I was very disappointed. DID NOT LAST LONG I WILL STAY WITH WELL KNOWN BATTERIIES I probably wouldn't buy these again. Each set of 4 batteries is individually shrink wrapped and very difficult to get apart. I'm sure batteries are fine if you don't mind the packaging. I'm sure batteries are fine if you don't mind the packaging Dont last long. I thought because they had the AMAZOn name they would be good, but they are no better than other generic batteries. In some cases you get what you pay for. These don't last like good batteries. But are a great price. If you have kids that leave toys on and run out batteries then these are good. I don't use them in the remote or anything I want to rely on for long term use. Kind of weak I purchased a box of these. First replacement for my outdoor weather info transmitter didn't work so well. Within a couple of days the receiver wasn't receiving a signal from the transmitter, so I changed out the batteries once again. Within 96hrs the receiver once again showed low battery power coming from the transmitter and wouldn't display a temperature reading. This week I'll replace those again (3rd time in 6wks) and expect a low-battery warning just days after. Unsure if I should demand an exchange or full reimbursement. Maybe they do well in warm temps, but in the cold temps they cannot perform like a Duracell or Energizer. Lack the power as advertised I've kept a stock of these batteries for about a year (in a drawer in my living room) and used them in my air freshener with no problems. However, when I used them with my Pawbo toy (it's a remote cat toy), not only do they not last very long, but I just went to replace the batteries and saw that were leaking after only a day! Leaked but may be ok with low-powered devices A day or two after these batteries arrived, I installed several of them in toys and our small keyboard (which also has A/C power). The next morning, my son called me into the living room, Mom! There's chocolate sauce all over the 'piano' and the table. It wasn't chocolate sauce. It was battery acid. As he said, good thing I didn't taste it!For what it's worth, the keyboard was plugged in, and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed. The five new batteries were in place for about 18 hours before the leak was discovered.The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table.The other batteries that I installed that day still seem to be okay, although I've developed a paranoia about checking them! I have used Amazon batteries in the past with no problems, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, instead of 1. The attached photo shows the rings that fell off. (I wish I'd taken a photo of the puddle they left on the keyboard and table, but I was too focused on clean-up to stop and take a picture.)You'll also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown. They came this way, and I'll use that difference to keep an eye on their performance/durability. Leaking within 24 hours I purchased a box of 48 AA batteries and the first 2 that I tried to use were dead the other 2 in the blister 4 pack worked fine, but a 50 failure rate is unacceptable. I will update how the rest of the box works as I try to use them. I will purchase a name brand next time. Little Savings For A Lot Of Frustration Might be okay. But, they seem cheap. They have warm light (orangeish in color). They have the feeling that they might only last a year or too, and not multiple Christmas seasons. We are doing a timer test and have one that does not want to follow the standard timer. Also, the window suction cup things are to small for these candles. They will ultimately work, but are going to be stretched to do so. Picture is of the loan gunmen candle (screw the built of n timer!!!). Loan gunmen timer Love Amazon, but these batteries lasted 3 weeks in my Roku controller, Family Dollar store brand lasted longer. I do have A LOT of them though. Well played planned obsolescence :l Love Amazon, but these batteries lasted 3 weeks in ... This was the 2nd time that I have ordered Amazon batteries only to find they all had about a half charge. Low Charge Batteries (per multimeter) While these batteries work, they don't last as long as expected. They lasted about 1/2 the time as a standard store bought battery (Energizer/Duracell/Rayovac). I will not buy these again. In contrast, the Amazon Basics AA Rechargeable is Awesome. Low performer... more than half of these batteries didn't even last but three months while in storage. what a disappointment! low quality, duds! Many batteries do not have full capacity. I read each with a meter before using. Often find one at .8 volt or below. I won't buy again. Many Dead or Low Voltage Batteries Not worth buying, these are just a slight grade above cheap Chinese batteries. Your going to replace them x2 or x3 times as often as top of the line batteries. So take the price of top of the line batteries and divide it by 2 and then compare the price with these. Not bad for the price but not worth the hassle. Maybe not worth it. Bummed. These batteries do not last long! Good for things like a clicker or something that isn't used often but we used these for Xbox one controller. With maybe 2 hours usage a day I've had to switch them out once a week. Meh These batteries work for normal things. But when i tried to use them for a dog collar that is supposed to help with barking, they were too weak and had to be changed after three uses. Annoying. Meh These die out super quickly. In saying that, I'm not sure if the items they were in sucked the life out of the faster but they still died. Used nearly a whole pack for little LED closet lights in a couple of months - only on for a few minutes at s time. Meh These just don't last as long as the name brand product. Found that we replace these twice as often as a Duracell equivalent. Won't be buying them again. Meh They don't last as long as other batteries. The Rayovacs that I get from Lowes are way better. Meh... A competing brand used to run my wireless trackball for two months, these last less than a week! Might as well have them shipped directly to the recycling facility. Some were nearly dead out of the box Mixed quality These batteries seem to have enough power. My sons remote monster truck barely moves with new batteries installed from her byut work perfectly fine with new Duracells. However, for basic other stuff they do the job. My sons remote monster truck barely moves with new batteries installed from her byut work perfectly fine with new Duracells Shortest battery life ever... definitely don't try to save a few bucks here ... Neeextt! It only took my little demons 3 days to figure out how to jimmie this thing open. It was really great while it lasted though. No good if you have smart and determined cats Amazon seems to have changed the manufacturer of this battery. I liked it very much the last year, but the new one has a different look, has noticeably lower capacity, and leaks. Batteries usually leak after they die, but these leaked while they were still good... and apparently died because of the leak. All of my devices have battery monitored One day they were good with 50-90 power left, and they died suddenly the next day. The leaks were mostly minor but clearly noticeable from body discoloration.One thing that has not changed from before is the packaging, and it is still bad. They are shrink-wrapped 4 in a package and they are hard to open as there is no cut-out or pull-tab to break the wrap. It is difficult to break open by hand. Twisting the package causes undue stress to the batteries and that may be cause of the leak. I have had to use scissors or knife to cut open the package. No good now. Do not last as long as other cut price batteries. In my Canon digital camera I cannot get off more than 3 shots before the 'low-battery' warning comes on. I am going back to Maxell, which did much better for me.I would hate to see what the capacity of the AmazonBasics EveryDay batteries are!!! Not 'Performance' after all poor performer, does not last long at all. not a very good battery. These are OK but they don't hold up or last very long. We bought these during Christmas hoping they would be great esp since alkaline but they barely hold up to the wear and tear of everyday use in a TV remote, let alone a kids toy. Not as good as expected These batteries drain quickly. While you get a lot of them, the quality just isn't there. If you need reliable batteries, look elsewhere. Not completely reliable. Despite what seems to be a great deal for a 48pack of AA batteries these aren't great. 2 stars only because of the deal as they're for light use. I use them only for my xbox controllers, I understand that the life is different with gaming (sucking up all the energy), but I've put a pair in before and about 2 weeks later had to change them. Not to mention, I have 2 controllers (one has a grip), so I switch between them often. This means they should last longer since I'm not just draining the battery life on one of them. Overall, not great for gaming or heavy use, otherwise they're nice backups. I'll have to compare these to say Duracell, but from past experience I don't remember having to change them so often. NOT for gaming (light use only) i have bought the AA 48 packs twice now and they are terrible... They don't even last a month... not good They do not last long. I literally added these to a flashlight that's typically never used. I used these batteries in that particular flashlight about 3 times for a total of maybe 3-4 minutes. I switched it on today, and the batteries are already almost depleted. I wouldn't purchase them again. Not good for the long haul Been going through a pair a week in my Xbox One controller. I play about 4 hrs a day average so the performance is underwhelming. Not good for wireless controllers apparently I used these in a mini led flashlight, which I use to walk my dog every night. I use the flashlight about 20-30 minutes every night and the batteries only last maybe 3 weeks. Not great. They do not last as long and I had hoped. Meaning they run down really fast. Would not buy again. Not happy with them. These are not comparable to Duracell. I have been running around changing batteries everywhere, remotes, clocks, battery-powered soap dispensers. All the dying batteries are the lame Amazon basics. Bought duracells at Costco. They probably last twice as long. I bought these to get free shipping on orders over 35. Don't do the same. It's not worth it. Very disappointing. Not long-lasting These are odd. Several times so far I have put them into some device and the circuit does not work so it seems dead. Tested the batteries with a tester and they read 1.6 volts, so they are fully charged. Put in energizers, duracells, that show 1.58 volts and the device works perfectly. Tried one of each brand and got mixed results. Good price but Ray o Vacs are about the same and no problem. I don't know what is wrong but for now, I don't like them. Not Reliable Marginal performance at best. Used one in my Turbo razor, and it died much earlier than other brands. It also dies quickly, with a steep power drop-off. Not the worst, but not the best. I've used 10 so far, 4 in a wire less mouse and had a short life , comparing them with Maxwell batteries I used before. Not too good so far. Not happy with quality. Do not last very long in various devices.My guess is that milliamp hour ratings are very poor/low.I have used many of these batteries in a short time span compared to Duracells. Not up to Quality standards. I thought that this was a great deal, but the batteries don't seem to last very long. I feel like I am constantly having to change the batteries in my remote. I would equate these to being a little bit better than dollar store batteries, but they are not of the highest quality. Not Very Good Don't seem to last as long as Duracell. Not worth it We are very disappointed in the quality of Amazon's AA batteries. They have failed 3 or 4 times in various products we own. The most costlywas it's use in our small wall safe in our home. The 6 batteries failed after two months and we had to have a service open it at the tune of225.00. Another example was a radio and flashlights. We will have to throw the rest out. OH NO, Not our Amazon! Don't seem to last very long changing brands Ok just didn't last long I bought these batteries to put into my bluetooth wireless speaker so that I didn't have to always have it plugged into it's AC power source. After only an hour of using my speaker with these batteries, my speaker died! I'm sad and disappointed that the batteries only managed to give me an hour of listening through my speaker, and honestly I'm shocked too. I read a lot of great reviews for these batteries and unfortunately, for me it did not deliver the quality that I wanted and needed :(. Only lasted 1 hour in a Bluetooth Wireless Speaker This pillow is made of memory foam but it is rock hard. It actually made my neck pain worse. The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that the fabric feels nice and seems well made. This may work for some people but not me. Pain in the neck. You get what you pay for. These batteries are cheap and don't last as long as Duracels or Energizer. If I had to estimate I'd say they last around 50 as long as those mentioned. Pay Less, Get Less I have used these batteries in several items from flashlights to toys. I have found them less than adaquate for the items they were used in. In my flashlights, I have found they last with average use about 3 weeks. Not very good. For controllers like TV remotes, they last less than a month. They may be cheper in the short run but they become much more expensive in the long run. I will not buy them again and suggest paying a bit more and getting the name brand batteries. Penny Wise Pound Foolish Batteries just don't have the strength or long run time. Read all the possitive and negative comments before I bought and they are true.These batteries are good to poor in performance. They start good and quickly drain down to poor. Under heavy load they drain very quickly, will come back with a rest but drain faster each time. Dont use in equipment that have a heavy demand. Clocks would be ok. Expect 1/2 the performance of the leading brands. Performance is up to par with price Buy these. They do not last at all. please don't Great price, however battery life is not comparable to other brands. Poor battery life I compared these against the Costco Kirkland brand and was quite disappointed with the Amazon Basic AA batteries. I used these in a flashlight test and after two hours, the Costco brand still worked fine, but the Amazon Basics were close to dead. I'm very disappointed with this brand and won't buy it again. For short term use, it's fine, but they don't last over time. Poor performance over time. Costco Kirkland is better. Don't think they were as good as the ones I get at Dollar Tree. I will not buy again they were a waste of money Poor quality price is good... look good on paper.. some i have are bad.. after few times use .won't buy again unless quality goes up.. price is good.. These batteries are very iffy. I have Mag-Lite's that require 3 AAA batteries and they have always drained the batteries equally, not with these batteries. I tried using my Mag-Lite this AM and it was dead. Did I leave it on and set it on it's end Nope. I checked the batteries and 2 of them were still good, but the 3rd wouldn't even register any voltage. This has happened 3 times with 2 different Mag-Lite XL200's and these batteries.Will not purchase again. Questionable quality. I thought I was getting a great deal, but I learned the hard way if you don' use them up quickly, they go dead in a hurry. Extremely limited shelf life so don't buy these in bulk if you don't plan to use them w/ in 6 mo.s. If your using them in medical equipment, I'm sorry to say I'm choosing another battery. I don't like bashing an Amazon product and there's always the chance I got a bad batch but in this instance, (medical equipment) you want power when you need, I had several groans from the bfrnd about his TV remotes eating up his batteries, I thought my wireless mice were eating them up as well, so I bought another mouse, but when I put 2 fresh packs in my ten's unit 4 ea. time they started out weak then didn't last 15 min ea.. set it's time to choose another brand of battery not the product your putting it in. I did test the one's I took out before putting the new one's in. I didn't think to test them before putting them in..... Questional Performance short capacity shelf life VS A Bad Batch You make the call The scale arrived earlier than expected, and came packaged nicely. No visible damage on the box, so I was excited to test it out. The scale came with batteries, which was very convenient. However, upon turning on the scale, I discovered that the entire lower line of the display failed to light up and change (I.E: an 8 looks like an A, 3 looks like a backwards F). Other than that, this scale would have been fantastic. One thing to note, the weighing platform is not silver itself, but rather appears to be a silver plastic. Scale looks nice, but display has issues. Important Part missing - the power cordStained and 2 different colored remotesNot acceptable Second hand and missing parts Seemed to die very fast.I only purchased amazon batteries about 6 months ago and already replaced them in more than one device that should last quite a bit longer.Noticed the same for the AAA Seemed to die very fast. I only purchased amazon ... They don't last very long. Short lasting These batteries do not have a long life. Short Life They had such positive reviews, I suppose it's possible that I got a bad batch. I've bought the Maxcell brand quite a bit which is slightly cheaper than these and I 'd compare them to Rayovak, not quite Duracell, but good. These lasted less than half as long, crazy! I had high hopes as an Amazon fan. Sad. Short life they last about half as long as duracell batteries do. they are cheap but they are not worth it. short life I was disappointed with these batteries. I thought they were going to be a higher quality and work as well as the name brand batteries. I bought these to use in my sons' leapster GS explorers. My sons do not play on them nonstop and they shut off on their own after being idle for a few minutes. These batteries don't even last 3 days. 8 hrs of use at the most! Because we can't afford to go through batteries so quickly, I change them once a week. It's really sad that they don't hold up longer. Time to go back to brand name as it will save money over these and use some rechargables. Do not buy if you plan on using these for something more than a remote or clock. Short life span. Very disappointing. They are batteries and they do work... but not for long. I pretty much base battery quality by how long they last in my wireless mouse. Generally I have to replace my home mouse every 5-6 months. I purchased these Amazon Basics AA Performance Alkaline batteries 3-1/2 months ago. In that time I've replaced my home mouse battery *3* times!! (The 3rd being yet again today.) My daughter has also gone through 2 batteries in her mouse as well (though she spends most of her time on her laptop with the touchpad).The shipping was fast and you get several batteries for a low cost, but I think a more economical way to go is to spend a little extra on name brand dependable batteries that last 2-3 times as long. Short life... These batteries don't last long at all. Short lifespan in wireless keyboard They didn't last the Christmas season....not even half of it. short lived 10 year storage life is a joke. I had some that I purchased only 8 months ago and when I went to use them, they already have zero juice left in them. I double checked with a battery tester and got zippo - zero. Not recommended. Short shelf life So at first I was happy, but my computer mouse started flashing red (low battery) about a week of having the new battery. Not impressed with battery life, but it works short term. Short term These batteries seemed to last about half as long as (Wegmans) store-brand AA batteries. Not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing that it's so many in a package. Disappointing. Short-lived Small for size,, and already separating from waistband. Will not buy again. Small and cheap not long lasting move on pay more get more so so I usually buy the 5.00 24 battery special at Harbor Freight, but they were not on sale when I needed some, so I decided to get theseBoth of the batteries are supposed to be Alkaline, so you would think they would both last about the same length of time NO SOI use these in a Personal Pedi Callused Skin grinder, so they get a good workoutAMAZON's batteries just don't last as long.... and it's a NOTICEABLE differenceI'm going back to Harbor Freight's Alkaline's so they get a good workout AMAZON's batteries just don't last as long I don't know if I just got a bad batch or not, but some of these batteries are partially discharged. I opened a pack of 4, put them in a device and it gave me a low battery indication. I swapped them out with 4 more from the same box and they worked. Some of the batteries are bad Several of the (new) batteries do not work. Very frustrating to replace a battery in an appliance and gave it not work and not know whether the problem is the appliance or the battery. Plus some things require several batteries and so it is hard to figure out which battery is not functional...I've experienced this with a couple devices (one wireless mouse and one kids toy) and trying different batteries resolves it, so I'm pretty confident the problem is the batteries. Some of the new batteries don't work Just opened a brand new box of Amazon AAA batteries 100 count . Sorry Amazon, but I had to open several packages of 4 only to discover. That most of the brand new batteries contained in the box arrived DEAD. I put a meter on the batteries to check for voltage. Some read 1v DC some read 0v dc and some read 2. volts. The batteries I removed from my head set were weak but at least had 1 volt As you can see in the photo the freshness date states 12-2026. . I certainly expect to find more dead batteries in that box. I don't have the time to check each package of 4 right now. Not good Amazon. I am concerned, because I purchase your packages of 9 volts and packages of AA as well. will I be surprised and disappointed as well Sorry Amazon. speak to your supplier Maybe I got a bad batch. However, with 48 batteries, you'd think if that were the case that some of them would work well, and for me they have not. The main way these are being used are in an Xbox remote. The Xbox is only used to run Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video on our tv, so I am basically using the game remote as a TV remote. It is never used for playing video games. That being said, I am lucky if a set of 2 of these batteries lasts 10 days in this remote. That is a far cry from name brand batteries I have bought. I purchased these thinking they would be a great deal. However, going through them 3x as fast as other batteries makes them a worse value, not to mention it is annoying to have to change them out so often. I will use up the ones I already bought, then I will not be buying any more. Sub-par Batteries Ok, terrible life span. terrible life span The price is good but they 'battery life' is much lower than other alkaline batteries we use. I get approx half the life from these batteries - compared to Walmart RayoVacs The price is good but they 'battery life' is much lower than other ... and then there's cheap. yeah cheap batteries alright but also cheap performance. these last half the time the C's house brand batteries, (in the same unit) for only just a little less money. disappointed as I was hoping Amazon might try to only put their name brand on half way decent stuff.there's a reason they send you a whole big box of 'em, ..... you'll go through 'em fast. there's cheap...... I bought these thinking, Great I can save some money!...... Well.... no you won't....I have to use batteries in my camera because I'm too cheap to go buy a new camera..so I bought all these batteries (2 big boxes) ....Usually 2 batteries last about 10 hours if I continuously use them, take a lot of pics.(like energizer)...... Seriously, these batteries last me probably 2 hours when using them a lot...... Not kidding.....I will not repurchase these....... These are a NO !!! work but short life these are not worth the money in my opinion These batteries are not very good. I bought them for the electric candles and after they were used 2 for 4 hours, the batteries were dead. My candles with everready are still burning after months. These batteries are not very good. I bought them for the electric candles and ... These batteries do not last long. These batteries do not last long. These batteries don't last very long at all. Save your money. I don't recommend These batteries don't last very long at all. These came with touch lights and they have been used for 7 days. The lights are already so dimmed and the batteries need replacing soon. These came with touch lights and they have been used ... These have been the worse batteries. I've bought these before and didn't have a problem but this batch doesn't even last a month. These have been the worse batteries. I've bought these before and didn't have ... These leaked battery acid twice over a two week person in LED lights which don't pull a lot of power. I will go for a brand name next time...I can't have my students getting burns from leaky batteries. These leaked battery acid twice over a two week person ... they are cheep so i guess you get what you pay for. i use them in my kids toys and they don't last long. they are cheep so i guess you get what you ... These suck! I may as well bought dollar tree batteries! We put them in three wreaths for Christmas lights that turn on for 4 hrs at night then turn themselves off with a timer and they burned out in three days, that's 12 HRS! Don't recommend.... They die in about 12 hrs of use! they do not last like other batteries. i use in candles with timers... i get maybe 2 weeks out of them... 50+ hours.... i use to get months out of my duracell.... they do not last like other batteries I have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as Duracell. I had assumed that since Amazon doesn't own a battery factory, that these are simply a major brand that is private labeled. So I assumed they would last just as long. My TV remote came with a Sony battery, it lasted a year. I replaced it with one of these and it only lasted 5 months. They don't last The tips seem to be polished so much that they do not make good contact. I had a problem where these batteries wouldn't work at all, but the duracell ones that I took out would. After swapping back and forth a few times, I took them to my battery tester and found that I had to twist them around to get them to register. So I took my batteries to some sand paper to get the contact point to work. They don't make good contact. I tried these thinking they were much less expensive than the brand name batteries and they would likely last a similar amount of time. I was wrong. I primarily use these in remote controls. While I don't have specific test results, the Duracell batteries would last well over a year in my Dish Remote. I purchased these in February and have already replaced the batteries twice. Perhaps I ended up with a bad batch, but I won't be trying these again. They just don't last The longevity of these batteries is nothing special. They do not compare to Duracell or Energizer alkalines. After reading the reviews, I was greatly disappointed. I used them, among others, for a wall clock and remote controller. Their longevity is no better than alkaline batteries marketed and sold by Walgreen's for example. Take this into consideration before you buy them. They just don't live that long They lasted really little.. (some of them) I use all batteries for same led lamps and 2 out of 4 Drained the Battery Quickly. They lasted really little.. (some of them) I ... Tried this out. Loved the box. The package of individuals of 4 each is nice but not convenient at times. We tried these on a high drain police radio and a low drain Samsung personal radio.STICKING WITH MAXELL. They out perform these and its noticeable for about 3 more. Better value. Trying These Batteries Out On High Drain Police Radio! 5 Stars So Far! Got them today. Came in twelve 4-packs stacked neatly in a compact cardboard box.HOWEVER,Two of the batteries were leaking so I threw away an entire 4-pack since all 4 batteries were a little slimy...but two were definitely leaking from the bottom. Makes me nervous that I had to use these in my three 120/ea. trail cams.The only reason I gave this a 2 star rating is the price for 44 batteries (instead of 48) was still a pretty good deal. Two of the batteries were leaking so ... 2 stars it is 2 of my candles stop working after 2 weeks!! Two Stars 2 way radio drained batteries daily so too expensive Two Stars A Great Price but not a great battery. They just don't last as long as the brand names. Two Stars About half of the batteries won't recharge, so I threw them away Two Stars Adequate Two Stars Bad shelf life. No where near Duracell. For very light duty only. Two Stars Batteries didn't last a year. Last several batteries were dead. Two Stars Battery Life on these is short. Disappointing. Two Stars Battiers dont last very long Two Stars can only use my wireless xbox controller for a few hours with two of these Two Stars Charge doesnt last Two Stars Died too fast sorry rather stay with the batteries sold in stores Two Stars Dies fast Two Stars Do not last long.

Two Stars Good price but didn't last to long Two Stars Half of the batteries were just dead Two Stars Half the batteries were dead or low charged out of the box. Two Stars I feel like they barely stayed charged. Two Stars I just dont trust em Two Stars I meant to purchase AA not triple Two Stars i use this batteries for my sound recorder and they exhaust way too quickly. Two Stars I was disappointed, they do not last but a few days. Two Stars I went through these like water - stick with Duracell or Energizer. Two Stars I'm feeling like these are running out of performance faster than other batteries I've purchased. Two Stars I'm not particularly happy four of them have already had to be replaced they don't last very long Two Stars It doesn't seem as though these have a lot of juice. They haven't lasted very long. Two Stars Lots of the batteries didn't work. Maybe just my experience. Two Stars More then half don't work Two Stars Nice cheap battery. Will not last as long as a regular brand battery. You can even feel the difference Two Stars Not fresh. Run down fast. Two Stars Not great for remote control car. Two Stars Only lasts half as long as the Rayovacs i usually purchase....... Two Stars Only slightly cheaper than name-brand and far less than half the capacity. Two Stars Poor longevity. Two Stars product ok Two Stars Seems like these don't last long at all Two Stars Several batteries don't work. Two Stars Some batteries didn't work Two Stars some battery is dead when I just use it, sometimes need change a lot of new battery Two Stars started leaking shortly after reciept Two Stars Stay away from this brand. Doesn't last long. Two Stars Strings are not as long as described. Two Stars The batteries came vacuum-sealed in packs of 4 in this really heavy/annoying plastic. Two Stars The batteries do not last nearly as long as other brands. Two Stars The package was delivered with only 40 batteries missing 8 batteries although it was perfectly closed and sealed Two Stars These batteries did not work in all items needing AAA batteries. I won't be ordering them again. Two Stars These batteries do not last very long at all. Two Stars These batteries don't seem to last as long as other brands.

Two Stars These die a lot quicker than typical energizer and duracell batteries Two Stars These die really quick.

Two Stars they seem to wear out really fast Two Stars They were cheap yes, and it shows. They don't last long at all. You get what you pay for... Two Stars THIS DIES SO EASILY Two Stars Very poor quality. Lasted on one week in motion sensor that is used infrequently. Two Stars Very short lifespan. Two Stars After several months of use the batteries have proven unreliable for production use in microphones. Duracell and Energizer are much more dependable have a reliable run-down pattern.However they work fine for in-home toys and games where you want cheap batteries on the shelf for instant replacement. Unreliable and short life battery Very disappointed with these batteries. I was using them in a wall clock. The clock repeatedly did not work after a new battery was put in. I figured the clock was no good, since the batteries were new. Bought a new clock, same thing happened. Decided to test the batteries prior to installation. I found that of the twenty batteries I tested, only 2 tested good. So therefore, my first clock probably wasn't bad in the first place, the batteries are faulty. I still have 12 batteries left to test, but I not hopeful that these will be any better. Very disappointed with this product I have several Amazon basics products and always tell my friends how much I love them. after purchasing Amazon basics AA batteries and AAA size, I was very disappointed. every single battery lasts a day or two on a power toothbrush, an xbox wireless controller, a roku remote and other daily gadgets. I am extremely surprised, since I buy batterie brands like rite aid, acme, Walmart, etc. very dissapointed These might be ok for remote controls and wall clocks that don't take much power. But don't expect to use them in you digital camera. The low battery warning comes on the instant I turned on my Canon 120IS point and shoot camera with afresh pair of these batteries. Within about 2 minutes the camera dies and won't restart without another fresh set of batteries. Very low capacity. Ok for wall clocks but no good for digital cameras. Very short life. I was really expecting a decent battery, but unfortunately it wasn't. Very short life. I was really expecting a decent ... Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my Roku remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for wireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor. But I've used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did. I'm talking a week and they are dead. I would not recommend them. Weak batteries I use these for my wireless mouse on my laptop. Not heavy use at all. But I am replacing these batteries at least once a week. I have to carry extra batteries with me, and I've never done that before. I used to go MONTHS with name brand batteries, so it's a dramatic difference. I'll use these up but I won't buy them again.That being said, this is the worst Amazon Basics product that I have bought. Everything else has been outstanding, so I'm really surprised at how bad these are.I have the AAs as well, and those don't seem to have the same problem. Maybe these are just part of a bad batch Well, they are batteries. Just not good ones. So these are cheap batteries, and you get what you pay for. However, when used in trail cameras during cold weather the performance is poor. Cheap Rayovac batteries from Menards (48AA for about 13.00) perform much better. Will not purchase again. when used in trail cameras during cold weather the performance is poor. Cheap Rayovac batteries from Menards (48AA for about ... WTH!! Went through these extremely fast - it seems there were many DUDS filtered in with a few good batteries!! by the time I realized this, it was over thirty days, so live and learn. Where's the Quality Assurance team not worth the money, they did not last very long, batteries would go dead, will not buy again will not buy again, batteries go down to fast BATTERIES have a very SHORT LIFE... WILL NOT RECOMMEND nor BUY AGAIN.. WILL NOT RECOMMEND nor BUY AGAIN These don't last long. Won't be buying anymore, wish they had been better! wish they had been better! They don't seem to be working very well - - last a day or so in the remote won't order again Over half were dead or real close to.dead and ones that did work lose power really fast. Very disappointed in Amazon on these and their aaa. Wont buy again I loved these batteries until 2 nights ago when one exploded in my camera flash. Not worth saving money on batteries when I now have to replace a 400 professional Nikon Flash. Battery acid leaked out of my flash door and all over my Nikon D600 camera and then on my hands before I realized what the loud,pop sound was. Worked great until one exploded in my camera flash I received AAA batteries and have reordered AA batteries as originally ordered. Wrong product shipped. These don't last as long as name brand of batteries like Duracell or energizer. They are cheaper but I'd rather pay a little bit more and have them last a lot longer. ... don't last as long as name brand of batteries like Duracell or energizer These batteries are ok for the price. They don't last very long in a device compared to other brand name batteries. There is a difference! I wouldn't buy them again. Amazon Batteries These were OK. I don't think I'll but them in the future. I prefer Energizers. Average They for really fast Bad batteries Batteries are very good, but packaging is horrendous, which is surprising because usually Amazon does a great job with hassle free packaging, but every four bats are packaged in tough plastic. Would have been better to just place the lot of bats in a simple box without the individual plastic wrap. Will not buy again with this packaging. Batteries are very good, but packaging is horrendous Somewhat disappointed with these batteries. They die rather quickly. I'm not using them for things that use a lot of power either. Like the remote for my TV. I have to change them frequently. Expiration date of 2026, but they go fast, unless I got a bad batch. I would rate them down there with cheap Rav-o-vac or a grocery store brand. Batteries don't last long These are nicely packaged and initially I was impressed - I didn't have to go to the store to buy batteries, they were cheaper than alternatives, and the packaging was great. I opened the first set of 4 AAA batteries and sadly found out one was already dead. We also ordered AmazonBasics AA batteries and had the same problem. 1/4 were dead. I hope this isn't a pattern for the rest of the box. Batteries were dead before we even used them they wear out to quickly. won't buy again. better off buying Duracell. better off buying Duracell I have encountered several AmazonBasics batteries lately which were dead on arrival. Since they are cheap, I just throw them in the trash and try some more. However this is concerning. If this occurs much more I will stop using them and purchase more traditional, reliable brands. Simply beware when you purchase these, some bad ones may be mixed in the batch. Beware that some dead batteries may be mixed in the batch I don't know how these batteries got such great reviews. They don't last nearly as long as the brand name batteries. Don't buy these unless you want to change batteries in your kids' toys and remote controls all the time. I'm super loyal to Amazon...but not with this product. Buy a brand name instead. These are low powered, don't last long even in tv remite you arelucky to get a week out of them. Energizer s last a year usually. Don't wasteyour money. buy energizer not these I've usually had very good experiences buying AmazonBasics branded items. I've found them to very comparable to the top brand names. These batteries are the exception. Quality wise, they are more comparable to Rayovac batteries than Duracell or Energizer. Buyer beware Only 3 worked out of the entire pack. Cheap and weak They're cheap but we went through these in less than half the time of the previous pack of the same, which was Duracell. I was hoping the brand wouldn't matter but it seems that in this case, it does. Cheap but definitely doesn't last as long as other brands While most, modern day batteries no longer contain mercury, the Amazon basics battery line unfortunately does. Which means they're bad for the environment, and not able to be disposed of other than in appropriate hazardous waste. I'll spend the extra few dollars and buy a name brand Contains mercury :( These batteries die quickly! Dead already died quick died fast Disappointed by the amount of time these batteries lasted. Disappointed These things do not last very long either in the product they are powering or on the shelf. The ones we had on our shelf were not even good to use after 4 months of sitting. Disappointed unfortunately These batteries do not last long at all as compared to Energizer. After 4 days of use they were no good anymore. The Energizer batteries have last me two weeks so far when using for the same thing. I will be using far more batteries so it really isn't a money saver. Disappointed! Disappointed! I've bought a lot of AmazonBasics batteries, and nearly all of them have been more than half dead on arrival. My remote controls won't even work with the brand new batteries in place. I won't be buying these again. DOA It doesn't work with my Amazon wireless mouse doesn't work with wireless mouse Won't buy again, I replaced batteries in my smoke detectors with these less than two months ago, replacing again with Duracell. The last Duracell batteries lasted almost 3 years in the same detectors. Don't waste your money on these, spend a little more for a good product. Don't waste your money on these The original Amazon Basics in the solid silver wrapping were great. These seem to have about a half life of those. Wouldn't recommend for use. Don't waste your monies I've used theses batteries in several devices now, and they always run out of juice much faster than typical AA batteries. Drain fast Not very long lasting batteries.... Duds Good price but batteries don't last long compared to other brands expected more quality These are so wasteful!! Rechargeable batteries are so much better!! The Amazon rechargeable ones are awesome!! And you can use and reuse and recharge and reuse them again and again and again and AGAIN!! Get rechargeable! Don't last very long Get the big name ones they dont last as long as the higher end rechargeable do or the regular batts do. I would say about half the time. half time I ordered these mainly to use in a set of small LED flashlights. I tried the batteries in three different flashlights, but they didn't work in any of them. I double checked polarity and they were correctly installed. I tried them in a different device didn't work in that either. Amazon sent me a second set free of charge. They still didn't work in any of the flashlights but did work in a remote control and a toy. (I tried a different brand of batteries in the flashlights and they worked fine.) So it was hit and miss with these AAA batteries--2 sets of them. I've used Amazon AA with no problems. Hit and Miss Unfortunately, some of the batteries seem to be duds. I have replaced dead batteries with these, only to still have a dead remote. Great price, but I now know why... Hit or miss... I purchased these to try because I needed so many for my Christmas village. Withing 24 hours some of the batteries died so I turned off all of them so I could at least have them on for Christmas. I am very disappointed in them, had to go out and purchase more of the copper top ones which last weeks and weeks to keep my village lit for the holidays. I will not purchase these again. I am very disappointed in them UPDATE June 2016Batteries do not last long at all. I am using mostly for wireless mouse. 1 battery last approx. 2-3 weeks. In my humble opinion, that is terrible. I retract my previous review.PREVIOUS REVIEW:Fantastic price, wonderful reliable product. I am a tried and true believer and purchaser. I retract my previous review DID NOT LAST LONG I WILL STAY WITH WELL KNOWN BATTERIIES I probably wouldn't buy these again. Each set of 4 batteries is individually shrink wrapped and very difficult to get apart. I'm sure batteries are fine if you don't mind the packaging. I'm sure batteries are fine if you don't mind the packaging Dont last long. I thought because they had the AMAZOn name they would be good, but they are no better than other generic batteries. In some cases you get what you pay for. You know these are just ok. They done last as long as the Copper top batterys. Just Ok Don't seem to last as long as other batteries, you get what you pay for. Just ok. A day or two after these batteries arrived, I installed several of them in toys and our small keyboard (which also has A/C power). The next morning, my son called me into the living room, Mom! There's chocolate sauce all over the 'piano' and the table. It wasn't chocolate sauce. It was battery acid. As he said, good thing I didn't taste it!For what it's worth, the keyboard was plugged in, and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed. The five new batteries were in place for about 18 hours before the leak was discovered.The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table.The other batteries that I installed that day still seem to be okay, although I've developed a paranoia about checking them! I have used Amazon batteries in the past with no problems, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, instead of 1. The attached photo shows the rings that fell off. (I wish I'd taken a photo of the puddle they left on the keyboard and table, but I was too focused on clean-up to stop and take a picture.)You'll also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown. They came this way, and I'll use that difference to keep an eye on their performance/durability. Leaking within 24 hours Been using Amazon AA and AAA batteries over the past 6 months in a variety of electronic items and have found that they do not last as long as higher quality, higher price batteries. I guess you get what you pay for! Low cost, but shorter lifetime I am extremely disappointed with these batteries, which stems not from longevity or power, but with fit. Almost immediately upon receiving them I installed them into three electric candles. No joy. I cleaned the contacts, still no joy. I tested the batteries, full charge. Just for grins, I installed into one candle three Ray-O-Vac brand batteries, and the candle lit with no problem. Removed the Ray-O-Vacs, installed the Amazons, and again, no joy. I repeated this a couple of times with the same results. And I tried this in the other two candles with identical results: All three candles lit with the Ray-O-Vacs, none with the Amazons. Knowing the issue was not with candles, I took a Ray-O-Vac and lined it up with an Amazon, and discovered something interesting: the batteries were just a wee bit different.The length of the positive terminals are different, just a tad longer on the Ray-O-Vac (see picture). The Ray-O-Vac terminal is taller (longer) while the Amazon terminal is squat-tier and therefore shorter. The difference in length is tiny, no question: but when you're putting batteries into a rather cheap device to start with, that tiny bit of length in this case seems to be the difference between one battery forming a sufficient connection and the other one not. I'll keep the Amazons to use in devices (mice, for example) that are likely more solidly built than these candles and have a greater connection tolerance (or a stronger spring) to hold the battery firmly in place. I am concluding that when replacing batteries in an older device (that may not force as firm a connection) or in a cheapo device that may not hold batteries tightly from the get-go, use a branded-name battery.I am a longtime and extremely satisfied user of Amazon Basic computer cables (among their first products in the Basics line), but was recently disappointed with another item I purchased outside of the computer connectors and cables line (that being dog house-training piddle pads, which have not proven as absorbent as similarly-priced products, and I've bought a lot of different brands). The batteries were my second foray into Basics product lines outside of the oh-so-dependable-cables arena, and now I'm 2 for 2 in the disappointed column. I never thought there was a difference in batteries, and now I know differently. The next time I see a Duracell commercial emphasizing reliability and dependability, I'll think back to this experience, as I will when selecting batteries in the future. I so wanted to like these Amazon batteries, too. Manufacturing Tolerances Matter I bought them to go into a flashlight. They never lasted more that a few hours and got really dim. maybe good for things like remote controls maybe good for things like remote Lasted one month in my carbon monoxide detector. Maybe these are good for other applications, but disappointed with their performance. Maybe these are good for other applications Bummed. These batteries do not last long! Good for things like a clicker or something that isn't used often but we used these for Xbox one controller. With maybe 2 hours usage a day I've had to switch them out once a week. Meh They don't last as long as other batteries. The Rayovacs that I get from Lowes are way better. Meh... These batteries do not last long. I put some in a portable can opener and was able to open about 10 cans. No long life here. Certainly not as good as Duracell. Some are very good........ others go bad in as little as two weeks. I put 3 in a plugged-in weather radio to serve as battery back up. Got a message that batteries needed replacing after only 2 weeks. A battery tester confirmed that they should be replaced. I guess I will go back to the Duracells. Not Duracell for sure Bought these for my digital camera based on a semi-professional review. Each set of 2 lasted less than an hour in my camera. Have used other brands of regular AA batteries and they have lasted much longer. If it's cameras you're buying them for, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. NOT FOR CAMERAS!!! ehh...they run out of charge very quickly....its honestly bad for the environment. they do seem to be a bargain but a brand name might come in a smaller quantity but will last longer than these..update 1: these batteries pack's have 50 working(short term) and 50 non-working batteries...I brought multiple battery packs and all have batteries that don't work.In my estimation, i think these batteries are not worth it. not great Good Value but they dont last very long not impressed These are not comparable to Duracell. I have been running around changing batteries everywhere, remotes, clocks, battery-powered soap dispensers. All the dying batteries are the lame Amazon basics. Bought duracells at Costco. They probably last twice as long. I bought these to get free shipping on orders over 35. Don't do the same. It's not worth it. Very disappointing. Not long-lasting I thought from the reviews that I had found a really good battery for less money than I usually paid for DuraCell but I was wrong. I put these in a my battery operated Halloween decorations and they lasted exactly 3 weeks on a 4 hour timer mode. The pumpkins where I used DuraCell are still glowing brightly. Guess it's back to the other brand for my battery operated Christmas decorations. Not really worth the money These batteries don't seem to last quite as long as regular brand name. Not so sure... I've used 10 so far, 4 in a wire less mouse and had a short life , comparing them with Maxwell batteries I used before. Not too good so far. Not happy with quality. Do not last very long in various devices.My guess is that milliamp hour ratings are very poor/low.I have used many of these batteries in a short time span compared to Duracells. Not up to Quality standards. About the same as Ray O Vac, not very good. not very good. These batteries were horrible. They died with a couple of days use. I figured since they were Amazon brand they would be good but I was mistaken. Sorry I would not recommend these to anybody. Not with it They simply do not last very long. Not worth the money. Not worth the money. This pillow is made of memory foam but it is rock hard. It actually made my neck pain worse. The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that the fabric feels nice and seems well made. This may work for some people but not me. Pain in the neck. Poor life. Buy a known brand. Poor life. Buy a known brand price is good... look good on paper.. some i have are bad.. after few times use .won't buy again unless quality goes up.. price is good.. The scale arrived earlier than expected, and came packaged nicely. No visible damage on the box, so I was excited to test it out. The scale came with batteries, which was very convenient. However, upon turning on the scale, I discovered that the entire lower line of the display failed to light up and change (I.E: an 8 looks like an A, 3 looks like a backwards F). Other than that, this scale would have been fantastic. One thing to note, the weighing platform is not silver itself, but rather appears to be a silver plastic. Scale looks nice, but display has issues. These batteries do not have a long life. Short Life So at first I was happy, but my computer mouse started flashing red (low battery) about a week of having the new battery. Not impressed with battery life, but it works short term. Short term not long lasting move on pay more get more so so Some batteries worked okay. I just had a problem where a new battery worked for a week and then there was no charge. Not worth the price. Some batteries worked okay. I just had a problem ... For the price and quantity I was sure this would be a great buy. Sadly, not all of the batteries worked. I first thought the camcorder we purchased was defective but when I swapped out the fresh, new batteries for a second round of fresh, new batteries from the same package the device magically came to life. Boo to you Amazon for selling batteries that don't actually work. Some work, some don't. These do not hold charge for long. Spend a couple extra bucks for the name brand. These do not work good in cameras. I use a small point and shoot Cannon Camera for work. With these batteries I seem to be changing them almost every time I go out. Other name brand batteries seem to last 3-4 time longer. Stick with a name brand in your camera. Maybe I got a bad batch. However, with 48 batteries, you'd think if that were the case that some of them would work well, and for me they have not. The main way these are being used are in an Xbox remote. The Xbox is only used to run Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video on our tv, so I am basically using the game remote as a TV remote. It is never used for playing video games. That being said, I am lucky if a set of 2 of these batteries lasts 10 days in this remote. That is a far cry from name brand batteries I have bought. I purchased these thinking they would be a great deal. However, going through them 3x as fast as other batteries makes them a worse value, not to mention it is annoying to have to change them out so often. I will use up the ones I already bought, then I will not be buying any more. Sub-par Batteries I use these for reading lights (the kind you clip on a book) which I use for coloring. The light gets dimmer after a few hours use the batteries I get from dollar tree last the same if not better. Duracell and energizer, however, last at least 20 hours before the light gets dim. the batteries I get from dollar tree last the same if not better. Duracell and energizer Would not buy these again. I reluctantly gave it a 2nd star because the price was good, but the batteries are pretty much 1 star. These get pretty good reviews so I was excited about them. Then the kids kept coming back WAY TOO FAST asking for batteries for their Wii remote. It didn't make sense to me until I tossed some in my blood pressure monitor. That thing runs for many months or years on a set of batteries, but not these! Only weeks with these. I don't have any kind of meter or anything like that to check them, but the proof is in the usage.......it's awful. Buy something else with a brand name. The capacity is NOT GOOD. I bought these thinking, Great I can save some money!...... Well.... no you won't....I have to use batteries in my camera because I'm too cheap to go buy a new camera..so I bought all these batteries (2 big boxes) ....Usually 2 batteries last about 10 hours if I continuously use them, take a lot of pics.(like energizer)...... Seriously, these batteries last me probably 2 hours when using them a lot...... Not kidding.....I will not repurchase these....... These are a NO !!! These leaked battery acid twice over a two week person in LED lights which don't pull a lot of power. I will go for a brand name next time...I can't have my students getting burns from leaky batteries. These leaked battery acid twice over a two week person ... they are cheep so i guess you get what you pay for. i use them in my kids toys and they don't last long. they are cheep so i guess you get what you ... I have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as Duracell. I had assumed that since Amazon doesn't own a battery factory, that these are simply a major brand that is private labeled. So I assumed they would last just as long. My TV remote came with a Sony battery, it lasted a year. I replaced it with one of these and it only lasted 5 months. They don't last I am all about Amazon Basics but I have ordered several of these for our baby toys and they don't compare at all to the Duracell ProCell that I normally order. Would love to go for a great generic brand but this just isn't it. I've been through several of these and they are consistently much faster to run out than the ProCells. They just don't last... This does not last for more than two months on my LG Magic remote.A basic remote truck lasts only for four days. This does not last for more than two months on ... Tried them in my amazon firestick remote and they failed to make the remote work. However, no batteries have made it work. Seems the Amazon firestick remote is the problem. In any event I am stuck with 8 batteries that I do not need. Tried them in my amazon firestick remote and they failed ... 2 of my candles stop working after 2 weeks!! Two Stars About half of the batteries won't recharge, so I threw them away Two Stars Adequate Two Stars Affordable Two Stars Bad shelf life. No where near Duracell. For very light duty only. Two Stars Batteries did not last very long! Two Stars Batteries do not last used all 48 after thanksgiving ned replacing to replace. Two Stars Battiers dont last very long Two Stars Buy for TV remotes. Stick with Duracell for anything else Two Stars Charge doesnt last Two Stars Do not last long. Two Stars Doesn't last long. Two Stars Don't last nearly as long as major brands. Two Stars Drain quick Two Stars Drains out quickly like cheap dollar tree stuff Two Stars Go with a brand name. Two Stars I'm feeling like these are running out of performance faster than other batteries I've purchased. Two Stars More then half don't work Two Stars not a fan, seem to run out quick Two Stars Not great for remote control car. Two Stars Not great for use in video game controllers. They drain really fast. Two Stars One in every three of these has leaked battery acid in a matter of days l. Two Stars Only lasts half as long as the Rayovacs i usually purchase....... Two Stars Only slightly cheaper than name-brand and far less than half the capacity. Two Stars The batteries go dead very quickly Two Stars These die a lot quicker than typical energizer and duracell batteries Two Stars These die really quick. Two Stars They didn't last as long as say Duracell..in my opinion. Two Stars They dont really last long Two Stars they need to be change to offen Two Stars they seem to wear out really fast Two Stars They were cheap yes, and it shows. They don't last long at all. You get what you pay for... Two Stars Wore out quickly Two Stars These batteries seemed to die very quickly. We used them for xbox one and wii controllers and while I wasn't the only person to use them, nor was I always around when they were being used to gauge the amount of their use, I seemed to have to replace batteries weekly. Used of Video Game Controllers Very disappointed with these batteries. I was using them in a wall clock. The clock repeatedly did not work after a new battery was put in. I figured the clock was no good, since the batteries were new. Bought a new clock, same thing happened. Decided to test the batteries prior to installation. I found that of the twenty batteries I tested, only 2 tested good. So therefore, my first clock probably wasn't bad in the first place, the batteries are faulty. I still have 12 batteries left to test, but I not hopeful that these will be any better. Very disappointed with this product These might be ok for remote controls and wall clocks that don't take much power. But don't expect to use them in you digital camera. The low battery warning comes on the instant I turned on my Canon 120IS point and shoot camera with afresh pair of these batteries. Within about 2 minutes the camera dies and won't restart without another fresh set of batteries. Very low capacity. Ok for wall clocks but no good for digital cameras. I have no issue with the actual batteries. They work fine. My problem is with the extremely wasteful packaging. The 20-pack comes in an oversized cardboard box with two slots for 10 batteries each. They could just as easily package them in a small thin cardboard box. Wasteful packaging. Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my Roku remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for wireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor. But I've used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did. I'm talking a week and they are dead. I would not recommend them. Weak batteries So these are cheap batteries, and you get what you pay for. However, when used in trail cameras during cold weather the performance is poor. Cheap Rayovac batteries from Menards (48AA for about 13.00) perform much better. Will not purchase again. when used in trail cameras during cold weather the performance is poor. Cheap Rayovac batteries from Menards (48AA for about ... BATTERIES have a very SHORT LIFE... WILL NOT RECOMMEND nor BUY AGAIN.. WILL NOT RECOMMEND nor BUY AGAIN Not a high performance battery, it's good for timer lights but not for regular usage, will not order these again... Will not recommend!!! They don't seem to be working very well - - last a day or so in the remote won't order again Over half were dead or real close to.dead and ones that did work lose power really fast. Very disappointed in Amazon on these and their aaa. Wont buy again\",\n          \"Love the capabilities it has to offer.Downside, it totally shuts off by itself and you have to start what you doing all over again Disappointed in it's performance. We bought this because we thought it would be great for reading books and playing a few games. However, awkward size makes the device very weird to hold and generally not enjoyable. The Fire HD 8 shares the exact same specs and has a higher battery life. There's almost no reason to take this device over the 8. Get the Fire HD 8, Not the 10 I do not find this as easy to use as my original Kindle Fire but I do like the camera a lot better, though it is not clear megapixels Kindle Fire #2 for me This is my 3rd Kindle. I have continued to move up on the screen size and this one is so easy to see and read. I do however sometimes have a problem with it when I am online. It can take forever to load up a site and move from page to page so that can be annoying. I have extremely fast internet so that is not the problem and when I check strength of wifi connection it always says excellent so not sure why it takes so long. Do not have that problem on my other 2. My 3rd Kindle Got this Kindle Fire to replace a laptop that died. So far I have been very pleased. Finding new things that it can do. Not happy with the camera, but I might not know all the details about it yet. My first tablet the first one I got was very slow. I turned it in today and this one works great not good and good I don't care for having to close each window separately I would prefer to be able to select close all or exit all ok but could be improved For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire. Amazon Kindle, Black It is difficult to understand the instructions. I am still working on it. Can it be used with the library? It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter. There are times that it's difficult to read because screen is not too bright Does its job In my opinion this model is too small and feels cheap. And sd card slot. Feels cheap There is no way to lock the font size and it changes if you touch the screen. I liked my paper white better but it died. Font size changes with no way to lock it Disappointed to realize there is not a light for night reading. Size and weight is great. Good but not great Its a decent reader for beginners. There is no backlight, so not good for reading in dark. also slips from hands, so purchase a cover if you buy it. Good for beginners The kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading Good for books This device is good for entry level reader only in daylight.Its doesnot support reading in dark. To read in dark you will have to purchase a light or cover case with light attached. I either case it will put a lot of strain in your eyes. Good for entry level reader This is a pretty cool little device. Im able to download books through wireless and read them later at my convenience. Only drawback is I wish it had more storage. But for the price, it works good. Good for the price This was my second kindle and I didn't realize that it wasn't paper white . What a difference. I took this back to the store and exchanged for paper white.. this was not easy to read for me No like It is affordable and it had Increased storage but no backlight and the screen could be better! OK I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes. Okay I bought it cause I wanted to read more. That didn't happen, I tried and I just can't read on devices I need old school paper between my hands Reading device The screen size could be bigger like the earlier versions of kindle. Screen Size could be bigger I just broke my 3rd generation kindle after many years, had to get a new one...the new kindle has more features in an intrusive format, it is hard to get books loaded, deleted, collected, and even to turn the page..an inadvertant tap on the wrong part of the page, or a twitchy finger, and you're down the rabbit hole..I really just want a reader, not another tablet too many bells and whistles I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.
